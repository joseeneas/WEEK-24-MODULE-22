# Python Environment Setup Summary

## Problem
The original script (`ig-04.py`) failed to run due to missing Python packages (matplotlib and tensorflow) and compatibility issues with Python 3.14 beta.

## Solution Overview
We successfully resolved all issues by:
1. Removing Python 3.14 beta (which had compatibility issues)
2. Installing Python 3.12 via Homebrew
3. Creating a virtual environment
4. Installing all required packages

## What We Accomplished

### ✅ **Removed Python 3.14 beta**
- Python 3.14 was causing compatibility issues with matplotlib and TensorFlow
- Completely uninstalled Python 3.14 framework and application files
- Removed broken symlinks from `/usr/local/bin`

### ✅ **Set up Python 3.12**
- Installed Python 3.12 via Homebrew: `brew install python@3.12`
- Python 3.12 has mature support for TensorFlow and matplotlib

### ✅ **Created a virtual environment**
- Created virtual environment: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv venv`
- Avoided system package conflicts using isolated environment

### ✅ **Successfully installed all required packages:**
- **TensorFlow 2.19.0** - Main machine learning framework
- **matplotlib 3.10.3** - Plotting and visualization library
- **tensorflow-hub 0.16.1** - Pre-trained model repository
- **tf-keras 2.19.0** - High-level neural network API

### ✅ **Script now runs completely**
- All import statements work correctly
- Image processing and neural network inference working
- Integrated gradients computation successful
- Visualization generation working perfectly

## Current Setup

**Python Version:** 3.12.11 (via Homebrew)
**Virtual Environment:** `venv/` (in project directory)
**Key Packages:**
- tensorflow==2.19.0
- matplotlib==3.10.3
- tensorflow-hub==0.16.1
- tf-keras==2.19.0

## Usage Instructions

### To run the script:

1. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run your script**:
   ```bash
   python ig-04.py
   ```

3. **Deactivate when done**:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

### To install additional packages:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install package_name
```

## Files Created
- `venv/` - Virtual environment directory
- `setup_summary.md` - This summary file

## Script Output
The script successfully:
- Loads pre-trained Inception V1 model from TensorFlow Hub
- Processes images (Fireboat, Giant Panda, Coyote)
- Computes integrated gradients for model interpretability
- Generates visualizations showing attribution maps
- Completes all 20 steps without errors

## Notes
- The virtual environment ensures package isolation
- Python 3.12 provides stable compatibility with TensorFlow
- All dependencies are properly resolved
- Script runs from start to finish successfully
