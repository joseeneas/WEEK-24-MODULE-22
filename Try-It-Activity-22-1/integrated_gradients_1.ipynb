    "# and the number of interpolation steps is set to 240.\n",
    "# The colormap used is `plt.cm.inferno`, and the overlay alpha value is set to 0.4.\n",
    "# The second call visualizes the IG attributions for the image 'Giant Panda'.\n",
    "# The baseline image is the same, the target image is `img_name_tensors['Giant Panda']`, the target class index is set to 389,\n",
    "# and the number of interpolation steps is set to 55.\n",
    "# The colormap used is `plt.cm.viridis`, and the overlay alpha value is set to 0.5.\n",
    "# The third call visualizes the IG attributions for the image 'coyote'.\n",
    "# The baseline image is the same, the target image is `img_name_tensors['coyote']`, the target class index is also set to 389,\n",
    "# and the number of interpolation steps is set to 55.\n",
